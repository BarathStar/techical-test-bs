Hermes QA Technical Test
========================

Objectives
----------

1. Create more test cases. Try and think about corner cases
2. Create some tests around vote counts. You'll probably need to implement some steps yourself for this.
3. Add a function to edit questions.
4. Add a function to find questions and answers from specific users.

It's OK if you don't manage all these objective. We're more interested in how you approach the problem.
